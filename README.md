# Library management systemit 
I have created a library management system using the OOPs Concept in python which we can also use in online library website after connecting it to database.
For this i have created a Library class which can store the record of each library exist and newly created libraries. In this you will be able to borrow books from any particular library, you can also able to add new book or delete existing book from the library. you can also check the logbook of the library which contains the details of the library like which person borrowed which book.
